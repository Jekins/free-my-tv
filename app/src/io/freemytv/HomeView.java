/**
 * The home screen, styled after the Apple TV app with the macOS 27 glass:
 *  - at the top left, the "For You" title and the tabs (Explore, Movies, Shows); at the top right, icon-only glass
 *    buttons (Live TV, HDMI Inputs, Settings), with the focused one's name below it, and the small crypto quotes
 *    (logo + price) at the right end of the tab row;
 *  - three cards with the titles recommended for right now in the selected tab (Recs, from TMDB); the background is
 *    the first card's photo, heavily blurred and almost white (Backdrop); without picks, one of your own photos
 *    (Photos) the same way, or else a light gradient;
 *  - at the bottom, the glass shelf with the apps (icons in each brand's color, like the tvOS Dock; the focused one
 *    grows);
 *  - ↓ on the shelf: everything moves up and the bottom drawer appears (inputs, shortcuts, weather for the next hours or days
 *    and quotes with the 24 h change); the background lightens (darkens at night). ↑ or Back closes it;
 *  - from sunset to sunrise, a night look: dark background, smoked glass and white text.
 * Measurements are in a 1920×1080 space (k = width / 1920). The screen is split into layers so the TV's weak GPU only
 * redraws what changed.
